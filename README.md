Hello!
I am keeping up with my studies with programming and getting into creative teaching with basic projects for kids, creating simple and nice looking tutorials at the STEM School I work.

This is a HTML/CSS/JavaScript music player. It has the basic functionalities to play/stop/pause the song and show info about the name and author for the song. It will display too the photo or cover of the album.

The UI was developed to be user friendly and cute, so this project could be engaging for my public (middle school kids) and too for devs that would like a cozy style.

You can check the page of this project here:<a href="https://fe-fs.github.io/MusicPlayer/"> MusicPlayer</a>

Enjoy! :D
